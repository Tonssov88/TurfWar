# TurfWar
Two player streetfighter game I made with a buddy for my computer science course. The theme of our game was "Flowers".
You play as two sunflowers fighting for control over fertile land

**SETUP**
In order to play: 
- Have pygame library downloaded
- Download files 
- run main.py
- 

Controls are given in-game but here they are:

**Player 1**
Left Arrow - Left
Right Arrow - Right
Up Arrow - Jump
V - Shield (Protects and relects damage)
B - Punch 
N - Kick (Longer range, more knockback but the player is stuck in the kick state for longer)
M - Dash (Need to be moving side to side to dash)

**Player 2**
A - Left
D - Right 
W - Jump
E- Shield
R - Punch
N - Kick
M - Dash

Things to note:
- Both players regenerate health during the day
- Players do not collide with each other so you can run through each other
- Usually the knockback stops you from being hit by a move for very long but when agaist a wall, the player can't be knocked backwards and takes a ton of damage. Avoid staying near the walls!
