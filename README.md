# TurfWar
Two player streetfighter game I made with a buddy for my Computer Science course
We were tasked with making a game about flowers

You play as two sunflowers fighting for control over fertile land

In order to play: (PYGAME IS NEEDED)
- Download .zip file
- Extract it to a folder
- run main.py 

Instructions/Controls are given in-game

When it is day, you both heal up slowly
Both players can move left to right, jump, dash in the direction you are headed, shield from attacks, punch and kick.
The game ends when one of the players runs out of health points.
